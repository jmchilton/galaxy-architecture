## Overview

Galaxy's architecture is built around several key design patterns and systems. This documentation covers:

- **Dependency Injection**: How Galaxy manages application dependencies and component construction
- **Startup Process**: How Galaxy initializes and configures the application
- **Application Components**: Core managers and services that power Galaxy

This documentation is the source of truth for Galaxy's architecture. It's maintained separately and generated in multiple formats:

- Training slides for the Galaxy Training Network
- Sphinx documentation (this project)
- Hub articles on galaxyproject.org
