    All repository goverance is done in the open on GitHub via Pull Requests and voting. Galaxy goes beyond open source to open goverance.

    > "The committers group is the group of trusted developers and advocates who manage the core Galaxy code base."

    > "Galaxy Project committers are the only individuals who may commit to the core Galaxy code base."

    > "Committers may participate in all formal votes, including votes to modify team membership, merge pull requests, and modify [policies]."

    > "Galaxy has grown a lot over the years, going from a project at one university in 2005 to the global community it is today. Several parts of the Galaxy ecosystem have become avowedly and obviously community driven during that time, including tools, code, training, and several other international efforts. Galaxy Working Groups push this global model to other areas of Galaxy as well."

    New large releases are issued roughly every 4 months. The process is guided by an auto-created
    self documenting release issue.

    Check out the [21.05 release issue](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/issues/11770) as an example.

    Working groups create roadmaps aligned with each release and coordinated with project leadership.

    Extensive use of Github tags are used to try to organize the numerous issues and
    pull requests of the Galaxy repository.

    The tags are described in detail in [issues.rst](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/doc/source/project/issues.rst).

  id: linting-and-code-formatting
  heading: Linting and Code Formatting
  content: |-
    Part of the Galaxy CI process includes linting and checking the format of both the backend Python and frontend ES 6 code.
    This linting process captures many common problems as well as enforcing a common code style.

    The output reports from the CI process are relatively straightforward, but it is a good process
    to lint changes and formatting your code before opening pull requests for them.

    Execute the `format` make command to format the backend code and then use `tox`
    to lint the formatted code.

    ```
    $ make format
    $ tox -e lint
    ```

    Execute the `client-format` make command to format the code and then the `client-lint` command
    to lint the formatted code.

    ```
    $ make client-format
    $ make client-lint
    ```

  id: mypy-and-python-types
  heading: mypy and Python Types
  content: |-
    Starting with release 21.01, portions of the Galaxy backend have
    Python 3 type annotations and static checking is performed as part of
    CI. Imported library types are not enforcing and
    [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) does a fair job
    inferring types in most situations, so this process should be
    relatively transparent to contributors.

    If there are problems with typing, the CI produces explicit output
    about how to correct problems. These problems generally just require a
    single type annotation. Feel free to request help on a pull request
    for what that should look like.

    To run a subset of the python type checking locally, `tox` again can
    be used:

    ```
    $ tox -e mypy
    ```

    A quick overview about why to add type annotations to Python code and how to use
    them can be found on this [blog post](https://dev.to/dstarner/using-pythons-type-annotations-4cfe).
    Additional useful resources include [this cheat sheet from mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet_py3.html)
    and the Python docs for the [typing module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html).

    Galaxy developers use a wide range of IDEs and we don't offer any formal recommendation of one over another.

    However, Marius has assembled some documentation on debugging the [Galaxy server](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/dev/debugging_galaxy.html) and [tests](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/dev/debugging_tests.html) using VS Code.
