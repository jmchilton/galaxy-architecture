  questions:
    - What is dependency injection?
    - Why does Galaxy use dependency injection?
    - How do I use DI in controllers and tasks?
  objectives:
    - Understand the problems with the `app` god object
    - Learn about type-based dependency injection
    - Use DI in controllers and tasks
    - Understand the benefits of typing
  key_points:
    - "`app` was a god object that knew/did too much"
    - "Interfaces break circular dependencies"
    - "Type-based DI with Lagom simplifies construction"
    - "DI works uniformly across FastAPI, WSGI controllers, and tasks"
    - "Dependencies should form a DAG"
