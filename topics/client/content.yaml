    - Source JavaScript for the client is in `client/src`.
    - Source stylesheets are in `client/src/style`.
    - "Packed" bundles served by Galaxy stored in `static/dist`
      - `run.sh` uses `git diff` to try to determine if client needs to be built before starting Galaxy
      - webpack builds these "compiled" artifacts

    Upshot - to develop against the client, modify files in `client/` and rebuild with `make client` before
    deployment.

    The following command rebuilds the application on each change.

    ```
    make client-watch
    ```

    This is still a relatively slow process, an extra client development server can be started that proxies non-client requests
    to your Galaxy server and selectively reloads only what is needed during active development (hot module replacement or HMR).

    ```
    make client-dev-server
    ```

    Make sure to open Galaxy at http://localhost:8081 instead to point at the client proxy.

    Packs and "transpiles" Galaxy ES6 code (.js), Galaxy Vue modules (.vue), libraries from npm, scss stylesheets (.scss) into browser native bundles.

    Hundreds of high-level well organized files into optimized single files that can be quickly downloaded.

    Lots of active development and complexity around Viz plugins and dependencies for instance, but the webpack configuration file in `config/webpack.config.js` is fairly straightforward.

    - Galaxy shared stylesheets are generally defined using the SCSS syntax
    - SCSS is a high-level superset of CSS - https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax
    - `sass` is leveraged by webpack to convert these styles to native CSS at client build time
    - Rebuild style with `make style`
    - Galaxy's SCSS files can be found in `client/src/style/scss/`

    The client is built from JavaScript source files. We use ES6 JavaScript.

    A tutorial to help learn JavaScript generally might be https://www.w3schools.com/js/.

    For someone familiar with JavaScript but that wants a primer on the new language features in ES6,
    https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp may be more appropriate.

    Vue.js is a reactive framework for building web client applications.

    We chose Vue.js over React initially because of its focus on allowing developers to incrementally or progressively replace pieces of complex existing applications.

    The idea behind Vue.js is fairly simple to pick up and there is a lot of great tutorials and videos available. https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/ is a really good jumping off point.

    - Clearly document the intent of your test
    - Implement logic in pure functions when possible
    - Wrap native browser resources in a function so they can be easily mocked

    Webhooks is a system in Galaxy which can be used to write small JS and/or Python functions to change predefined locations in the Galaxy client.
