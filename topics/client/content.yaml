    - Source JavaScript for the client is in `client/src`.
    - Source stylesheets are in `client/src/style`.
    - "Packed" bundles served by Galaxy stored in `static/dist`
      - `run.sh` uses `git diff` to try to determine if client needs to be built before starting Galaxy
      - webpack builds these "compiled" artifacts

    Upshot - to develop against the client, modify files in `client/` and rebuild with `make client` before
    deployment.

    The following command rebuilds the application on each change.

    ```
    make client-watch
    ```

    This is still a relatively slow process, an extra client development server can be started that proxies non-client requests
    to your Galaxy server and selectively reloads only what is needed during active development (hot module replacement or HMR).

    ```
    make client-dev-server
    ```

    Make sure to open Galaxy at http://localhost:8081 instead to point at the client proxy.

    Galaxy is replacing Bootstrap-Vue with custom components:

    - **Reduce dependency** - Prepare for framework upgrades
    - **Improve consistency** - Unified design language
    - **Enhance accessibility** - Built-in a11y
    - **Simplify maintenance** - Galaxy-specific needs
- type: prose
  id: component-library-context
  content: |
    The Galaxy client historically used Bootstrap-Vue for UI components. As Bootstrap-Vue's
    maintenance slowed and Galaxy's needs became more specific, the team began building a
    custom component library.

    The library lives in two locations:
    - `client/src/components/BaseComponents/` - Core interactive components (GButton, GLink, GModal)
    - `client/src/components/Common/` - Higher-level reusable components (GCard)
- type: slide
  id: deprecated-bootstrap-components
  heading: Deprecated BootstrapVue Components
  class: enlarge120
  content: |
    **Do not use these in new code:**

    | BootstrapVue | Use Instead |
    |--------------|-------------|
    | `BButton`, `b-button` | `GButton` |
    | `BLink`, `b-link` | `GLink` |
    | `BModal`, `b-modal` | `GModal` |
    | `BCard`, `b-card` | `GCard` |

    Existing usages should be migrated when touching related code.
- type: prose
  id: deprecated-components-details
  content: |
    ## Component Migration Reference

    When writing new Vue components or modifying existing ones, always prefer Galaxy's
    custom components over their Bootstrap-Vue equivalents.

    ### GButton replaces BButton

    ```vue
    <!-- ❌ Deprecated -->
    <BButton variant="primary" size="sm" :disabled="busy">Submit</BButton>

    <!-- ✅ Use instead -->
    <GButton color="blue" size="small" :disabled="busy">Submit</GButton>
    ```

    Key differences:
    - `variant` → `color` (grey, blue, green, yellow, orange, red)
    - `size="sm"` → `size="small"` (small, medium, large)
    - Built-in tooltip support via `tooltip` prop
    - Polymorphic: renders as `<button>`, `<a>`, or `<router-link>` based on props

    See: `client/src/components/BaseComponents/GButton.vue`

    ### GLink replaces BLink

    ```vue
    <!-- ❌ Deprecated -->
    <BLink href="#" @click="doSomething">Click here</BLink>

    <!-- ✅ Use instead -->
    <GLink @click="doSomething">Click here</GLink>
    ```

    See: `client/src/components/BaseComponents/GLink.vue`

    ### GModal replaces BModal

    ```vue
    <!-- ❌ Deprecated -->
    <BModal v-model="showModal" title="Confirm" ok-only>Content</BModal>

    <!-- ✅ Use instead -->
    <GModal v-model:show="showModal" title="Confirm" confirm>Content</GModal>
    ```

    Key differences:
    - Uses native `<dialog>` element for better accessibility
    - `v-model` → `v-model:show`
    - `ok-only` → `confirm`

    See: `client/src/components/BaseComponents/GModal.vue`

    ### GCard replaces BCard and custom card layouts

    ```vue
    <!-- ❌ Deprecated custom layout -->
    <div class="workflow-card">
      <div class="card-header"><h3>{{ name }}</h3></div>
      <div class="card-body">{{ description }}</div>
    </div>

    <!-- ✅ Use instead -->
    <GCard :id="id" :title="name" :description="description" />
    ```

    GCard provides a comprehensive props-driven API with support for actions, badges,
    indicators, tags, bookmarks, and selection state.

    **Migration strategy:**

    1. **New code** - Always use Galaxy components
    2. **Modified code** - Migrate when touching files
    3. **Batch migrations** - Periodic focused efforts

    Reference PRs:
    - [#19963](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/19963) - Buttons
    - [#20063](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/20063) - Links

    - [#19785](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/19785) - Cards

    ## Migration Effort

    The component library migration is ongoing and incremental. Bootstrap-Vue and Galaxy
    components coexist during the transition.

    ### Finding Components to Migrate

    ```bash
    # Find BButton usages
    grep -r "BButton\|b-button" client/src --include="*.vue"

    # Find BModal usages
    grep -r "BModal\|b-modal" client/src --include="*.vue"
    ```

    ### Coexistence with Bootstrap

    - Some Galaxy components (GCard) still use Bootstrap internally for badges/dropdowns
    - CSS may use `!important` to override Bootstrap styles where needed
    - Gradual migration allows testing without breaking changes

    - **Polymorphic** - Same API for button, anchor, router-link
    - **Integrated tooltips** - Built-in via `title` + `tooltip` props

    - **Composable internals** - Shared logic in composables
- type: prose
  id: component-patterns-details
  content: |
    ## Component Library Patterns

    ### Polymorphic Components

    GButton and GLink render as different HTML elements based on props:

    ```vue
    <GButton @click="action">Button</GButton>     <!-- <button> -->
    <GButton href="/page">Anchor</GButton>        <!-- <a> -->
    <GButton to="/route">Router Link</GButton>    <!-- <router-link> -->
    ```

    See: `client/src/components/BaseComponents/composables/clickableElement.ts`

    ### Integrated Tooltips

    ```vue
    <!-- ❌ Bootstrap-Vue (directive) -->
    <BButton v-b-tooltip.hover title="Click me">Button</BButton>

    <!-- ✅ Galaxy (integrated prop) -->
    <GButton tooltip title="Click me">Button</GButton>
    ```

    See: `client/src/components/BaseComponents/GTooltip.vue`

    ### Semantic Colors

    Available colors: `grey` (default), `blue`, `green`, `yellow`, `orange`, `red`

    See: `client/src/components/BaseComponents/componentVariants.ts`
- type: slide
  id: creating-component-wrappers
  heading: Creating a Component Wrapper
  class: enlarge150
  content: |
    Follow established patterns:

    1. Use `ComponentColor` and `ComponentSize` types
    2. Integrate tooltips via `title`/`tooltip` props
    3. Use shared composables for common logic
    4. Apply CSS custom properties for theming
    5. Include ARIA attributes for accessibility

    See existing components in `client/src/components/BaseComponents/`

    ## Creating a New Component Wrapper

    ### Key Files to Reference

    - **Type definitions**: `client/src/components/BaseComponents/componentVariants.ts`
    - **Shared composables**: `client/src/components/BaseComponents/composables/`
      - `clickableElement.ts` - Determines element type from props
      - `currentTitle.ts` - Handles disabled title switching
    - **Tooltip integration**: `client/src/components/BaseComponents/GTooltip.vue`

    ### Standard Props Pattern

    ```typescript
    import type { ComponentColor, ComponentSize } from "./componentVariants";

    interface Props {
      color?: ComponentColor;       // grey, blue, green, yellow, orange, red
      size?: ComponentSize;         // small, medium, large
      disabled?: boolean;
      title?: string;
      disabledTitle?: string;
      tooltip?: boolean;
    }
    ```

    ### CSS Custom Properties

    Use Galaxy's design tokens:

    ```scss
    .g-component {
      padding: var(--spacing-2);
      font-size: var(--font-size-medium);
      background-color: var(--color-grey-100);
    }
    ```

    ### Accessibility

    - Use semantic HTML elements (`<button>`, `<dialog>`)
    - Include `aria-disabled`, `aria-describedby`
    - Support keyboard navigation
    - Use GTooltip for accessible hover text
- type: slide

    Likely next components based on Bootstrap-Vue usage:

    - **GDropdown** - Dropdown menus
    - **GTable** - Data tables with sorting
    - **GTabs** - Tab navigation
    - **GCollapse** - Collapsible sections
