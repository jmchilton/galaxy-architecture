title: Galaxy Markdown Architecture
training:
  tutorial_number: 7
  subtitle: Portable, reproducible documentation with embedded Galaxy objects.
  questions:
    - What is Galaxy Markdown and how does it differ from regular HTML?
    - How do contextual references get resolved to internal IDs?
    - What is the transformation pipeline for Galaxy Markdown?
    - How do frontend components render Galaxy directives?
  objectives:
    - Understand the contextual addressing system for Galaxy Markdown
    - Learn the backend parsing and transformation pipeline
    - Understand the handler pattern for export/rendering
    - Know how frontend components process Galaxy directives
    - Learn the editor architecture for pages and reports
  key_points:
    - "Galaxy Markdown enables portable documentation via contextual addressing"
    - "Multiple context-specific formats converge to internal IDs at boundaries"
    - "Handler pattern enables lazy (frontend) vs eager (PDF) export"
    - "27+ directives for embedding Galaxy objects"
    - "Frontend uses store-centric data flow for caching"
